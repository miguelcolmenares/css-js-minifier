# Extension Architecture

## Overview

The CSS & JS Minifier extension follows a modular architecture pattern that separates concerns into distinct layers for better maintainability, testability, and code reusability.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Extension Entry Point (`src/extension.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Clean activation/deactivation lifecycle management
- **Responsibilities**: Command registration, event listener setup, configuration management
- **Size**: Reduced from 220 → 81 lines (63% reduction)

### 2. Commands Layer (`src/commands/`)
- **Purpose**: VS Code command handlers and user interaction logic
- **Components**:
  - `minifyCommand.ts` - Unified command logic with processDocument() core function
  - `index.ts` - Command exports with comprehensive documentation

### 3. Services Layer (`src/services/`)
- **Purpose**: Business logic and external API integrations
- **Components**:
  - `minificationService.ts` - Toptal API communication with error handling
  - `fileService.ts` - File system operations and filename utilities
  - `index.ts` - Service exports with module documentation

### 4. Utils Layer (`src/utils/`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable validation and utility functions
- **Components**:
  - `validators.ts` - File type and content validation with user feedback
  - `index.ts` - Utility exports with module documentation

## Benefits of Modular Architecture

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Clear boundaries between UI logic, business logic, and utilities
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality

### ✅ Code Reusability
- No duplicate validation or API logic between commands
- Shared utilities across different command handlers
- Consistent error handling patterns

### ✅ Enhanced Testability
- Pure functions easier to unit test
- Isolated business logic can be tested independently
- Mocking external dependencies is straightforward

### ✅ Improved Maintainability
- 63% reduction in main file complexity
- Self-documenting code with comprehensive JSDoc
- Clear module dependencies and exports

### ✅ Better Developer Experience
- IntelliSense support for all module functions
- Type safety with proper interfaces
- Consistent coding patterns throughout

## Data Flow

```
User Action (Command/Keybinding/Context Menu)
    ↓
Command Handler (commands/minifyCommand.ts)
    ↓
Validation (utils/validators.ts)
    ↓
Minification Service (services/minificationService.ts)
    ↓
File Operations (services/fileService.ts)
    ↓
User Feedback (VS Code Notifications)
```

## Module Dependencies

```
extension.ts
    ↓
commands/index.ts
    ↓
commands/minifyCommand.ts
    ↓
├── utils/validators.ts
├── services/minificationService.ts
└── services/fileService.ts
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Layered Error Handling
1. **Validation Layer**: Input validation with user-friendly messages
2. **Service Layer**: API error handling with retry logic and specific error codes
3. **Command Layer**: Coordination and user notification
4. **Extension Layer**: Global error catching and logging

### User Experience Focus
- All errors show appropriate VS Code notifications
- Context-aware error messages (file type, network issues, API limits)
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Configuration Management

### Centralized Settings
- All configuration accessed through `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration()`
- Settings validated at the point of use
- Default values provided for all optional settings

### Dynamic Configuration
- Settings can be changed without extension restart
- Configuration changes take effect immediately
- Per-workspace and global configuration support

## Performance Optimizations

### Lazy Loading
- Modules loaded only when needed
- Webpack bundling for optimal distribution size
- Tree shaking removes unused code

### API Efficiency
- Request debouncing for rapid user actions
- Response caching where appropriate
- Timeout handling for slow network conditions

## Future Extensibility

### Plugin Architecture Ready
- Service layer can be extended with new minification providers
- Command layer supports additional file types
- Validation layer can accommodate new file formats

### Internationalization Support
- All user-facing strings externalized to `.nls` files
- Message formatting prepared for multiple languages
- Locale-specific error handling
