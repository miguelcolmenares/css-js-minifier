## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- **Size Reduction Statistics**: Display percentage of size reduction and file sizes after minification
  - Shows original and minified file sizes in human-readable format (KB or B)
  - Calculates and displays percentage of size reduction
  - Handles edge cases (no reduction, same size files)
  - Works with both in-place minification and new file creation
- New configuration option: `showSizeReduction` (default: true)
  - Allows users to toggle size statistics display on/off
  - When disabled, shows traditional success messages
- **Internationalization (i18n) Support**: Full multi-language support for 7 languages
  - ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (default)
  - ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish
  - ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French
  - ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German
  - ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese (Brazilian)
  - ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japanese
  - ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ Chinese Simplified
- Runtime message bundles using @vscode/l10n package
- 17 internationalized runtime messages across all user notifications
- 13 internationalized configuration and command labels
- Comprehensive i18n test suite with 20+ tests
- i18n architecture documentation (docs/INTERNATIONALIZATION.md)
- VS Code task for running i18n tests separately

### Changed
- All hardcoded user-facing strings replaced with l10n.t() calls
- Error messages now support parameter interpolation
- Success notifications now properly internationalized
- README updated with language support information

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- Complete modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation across all modules  
- Issue #5 resolution: autoOpenNewFile configuration option
- Issue #1 resolution: Enhanced error handling for CSS nth-child selectors
- Comprehensive test suite for all issues and configuration scenarios
- API timeout handling with Promise.race pattern (5000ms timeout)
- 5MB file size validation to prevent API errors
- Enhanced HTTP error handling with specific status code messages
- i18n documentation and translation maintenance guidelines

### Changed
- **BREAKING REFACTOR**: Restructured codebase into modular architecture
  - `src/commands/`: Command handlers and core business logic
  - `src/services/`: External API integration and file operations
  - `src/utils/`: Validation utilities and helper functions
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with practical examples for all functions
- Enhanced error handling with detailed user feedback
- Type safety improvements with interfaces and proper typing
- Reduced main extension file size by 63% (220â†’81 lines)
- Enhanced minification service with comprehensive error handling
- Improved file service with configuration-aware functionality
- Updated project documentation with modular architecture details

### Fixed
- Issue #5: Minify on save now respects minifyInNewFile configuration
### Issue #1: CSS nth-child Selector Minification\n- **Status**: âœ… **FULLY RESOLVED** - nth-child selectors minify correctly\n- **Root Cause**: Previous architectural improvements resolved underlying API issues\n- **Verification**: Independent testing confirms 41% size reduction (479â†’279 characters)\n- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with complex nth-child patterns\n- **Validation**: Mathematical expressions, selector filtering, and complex combinations work perfectly
- Timeout issues during API calls with proper Promise.race implementation
- Silent failures now show appropriate user error messages
- File size validation prevents 413 HTTP errors for large files
- Eliminated code duplication between minify commands
- Improved code reusability and maintainability
- Enhanced documentation standards across all modules

### New Features

- **Robust Timeout Handling**: Added 5000ms timeout for API calls with Promise.race pattern
  - Handles API responses observed up to 1100ms in performance testing
  - Specific error messages for timeout vs connectivity issues
  - Improved user experience with clear, actionable error feedback
  - Graceful degradation when external APIs are slow or unresponsive

- **Enhanced API Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling based on updated Toptal API documentation
  - **File Size Validation**: Pre-request validation for 5MB maximum file size limit
  - **HTTP Status Code Handling**: Specific user messages for all API error codes (400, 405, 406, 413, 422, 429)
  - **JSON Error Parsing**: Extracts detailed error messages from API JSON responses when available
  - **Rate Limit Awareness**: Clear messaging when hitting 30 requests/minute limit
  - **Syntax Error Details**: Informative feedback for CSS/JavaScript syntax errors with precise error descriptions

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Minify on Save**: Resolved issue where minify on save didn't respect `minifyInNewFile` configuration
  - Now properly creates new files when `minifyInNewFile: true` is set
  - Maintains in-place minification when `minifyInNewFile: false` (default behavior)
  - Respects all user configuration settings during auto-minification on save

- **New Configuration Option**: Added `autoOpenNewFile` setting to control file opening behavior
  - When `true` (default): Newly created minified files open automatically in editor
  - When `false`: Files are created silently without opening, reducing editor clutter
  - Addresses user request for less intrusive minification workflow

### Technical Improvements

- Migrate to ESLint v9 flat config for better compatibility
- Optimize GitHub Actions cache strategy across all workflows
- Optimize CodeQL execution to run only on PRs and weekly schedule
- Standardize action versions to checkout@v5
- Enhanced test suite with automatic Sinon spy cleanup
- Updated error message validation in tests for new architecture
- Improve CI/CD efficiency and reduce resource usage
- Fix auto-merge workflow: Remove GitHub Actions approval restrictions

- Explorer context menu to minify css & js files
- Keyboard shortcuts for minify css & js files
- Prefix options for minified files (.min, -min, .compressed, etc.)
- File extension validation and content length validation before minifying
- Internazionalization support with Spanish translation
- Auto-minification on save (configurable)
- Test cases and comprehensive testing

### Fixed

- Update keybindings configuration to avoid conflicts with macOS default keybindings
- Demo images in README.md

### Changed

- Updated extension icon
- Updated README.md with new features and documentation
